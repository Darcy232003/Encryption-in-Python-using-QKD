Encryption Decryption in Python with using QKD, AES and cryptography library.

The BB84 protocol, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, is a foundational protocol in the realm of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a cornerstone of quantum physics, is what determines BB84's security. According to this principle, it is impossible to know a qubit's basis and state (0 or 1) at the same time with perfect accuracy. Unlike traditional cryptography which relies on computational complexity to make breaking the code difficult, BB84 exploits the fundamental properties of qubits (quantum bits) to achieve security.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher, widely recognized as the most secure and robust algorithm for encrypting electronic data. AES operates on data blocks (often 128, 192, or 256 bits) and uses a secret key of the same length to transform the data into unreadable ciphertext. This ciphertext can only be decrypted to the original plaintext with the same secret key.
